*Newest feature(s):
-- The changelog will now be sent to your SYSTEM CHANNEL every time the bot reloads if new changes are added.
---- Changing SYSTEM CHANNEL to None will disable these notifications.

Relatively new features:
-- You'll get notifications less frequently now for messages that took some time to send.
---- Note that sending media with a vanity will cause a guarenteed delay than sending text.
-- Added a new internal safety feature that prevents the bot from reseting data should the data file be lost.
---- Data WILL be reset if the file is lost and the bot is closed. This should be an unlikely event.
---- The bot's status will change when saving is disabled. The developer will have to create a new file should it be lost.
-- You'll now get proper DMs when the bot is unable to delete your messages.
-- Previous avatars will now load the last avatar you had on, EXCLUDING the one you're currently using.
---- If you have a vanity on, and you use the :>_set command with no parameters, it will load the previous avatar.

In case you missed it:
New Features:
-- Moderation commands (see ':>help commands' under Moderation)
---- These commands allow moderators with specific permissions to limit how users can use this bot.
