# Testing branch for MWSRam
This is where testing files are kept.\
When finished, merge files into `master` branch. \
It's acceptable to **completely overwrite** `master`'s files from `master-testing` branch **if ready.**\
When commiting changes that confict with `master`, make new branch to **MERGE** (**not overwrite**) with `master-testing`.
